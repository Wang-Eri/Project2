Hi!


The purpose of this project is to simulate how the libary management works. 

In this project, i created a local database to store the basic information, like the book_num, users' account number and so on.

I practise my database skills through this project, like how to insert, delete data from a local database. 

This is not a formal school projects, i start this project purely becasue of interests.

I will continuely working on the project and update the contents!
